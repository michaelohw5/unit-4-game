# unit-4-game
This code is homework for the *web development bootcamp* course.
In this homework I use **JQuery DOM manipulation** to create a simple game.
In the beginning of the game, a *random number* is selected as a goal.
Also, *four* random numbers are generated, and assigned to each picture of gems.
When the user clicks each gem, the gem's value is added to the user's score.
When the score matches the goal, user **wins**. If the score exceeds the goal, the user **loses**.
